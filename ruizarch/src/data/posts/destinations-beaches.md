Sri Lanka's attractions are incredibly varied, and travelers often craft itineraries by mixing cultural sites, nature parks, and coastal retreats. In the Cultural Triangle of the north-central plains lie three of the country's UNESCO World Heritage sites: the Sacred City of Anuradhapura, the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa, and the rock fortress of Sigiriya. Each showcases a chapter of Sri Lankan history. Anuradhapura was Sri Lanka's first major capital (circa 4th century BC) and features towering dagobas (stupas) and a sacred Bo tree. Polonnaruwa (10th-12th century AD) has well-preserved palaces and temples. Sigiriya, also known as "Lion Rock", is a massive 200-meter-high rock with elaborate frescoes and a dramatic palace on top - it was named one of the new Seven Wonders of the World in 2021. Climbing Sigiriya rewards you with sweeping views and a sense of history. 
Nearby is Dambulla Cave Temple (Golden Temple), another UNESCO site: a series of caves filled with painted ceilings and hundreds of Buddha statues. Farther south is Kandy, a lush city nestled in hills, famous for the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa). This Buddhist shrine is one of Sri Lanka's holiest sites and draws pilgrims and visitors every day. In colonial times, Kandy was the last kingdom to fall to the British in 1815. Today its lake, botanical gardens, and cultural performances (like traditional Kandyan dance) make it a highlight. Another colonial-era gem is Galle Fort on the southwest coast - a historic Dutch-built fortress town with ramparts, boutique shops, and ocean views.

If you head inland into the hills, don't miss the scenic train ride from Kandy to Ella. This journey has been featured as one of the world's most picturesque train rides. The train chugs through misty tea plantations, mountains, and waterfalls - so iconic that many visitors describe it as an attraction itself. Ella (a hill town) offers hiking (like Little Adam's Peak) and a laid-back vibe. Close by is Nuwara Eliya, a cool-climate "hill station" where British colonial architecture and flower gardens give it an "England in Asia" feel. Touring a tea plantation or sipping fresh Ceylon tea here is a delight.

Down south, the coast calls. Unawatuna and Mirissa are famous for beaches, reef snorkeling, and whale watching respectively. Surf lovers head to Arugam Bay on the east coast, widely ranked among the top surf spots globally. For wildlife, Yala and Udawalawe National Parks in the south-east and south host impressive animal encounters (leopards, elephants, sloth bears, peacocks). Visiting the Minneriya or Kaudulla Parks during the dry season (July-Sept) allows you to see enormous herds of wild elephants gathered at the watering holes.

Colombo, the bustling capital, is often people's entry point. The city offers colorful markets, colonial architecture (like the old Dutch Hospital area), and a lively waterfront promenade (Galle Face Green). It's a modern contrast to the ancient ruins and rural scenery, but visitors appreciate its energy and hotels. From Colombo, it's easy to reach airports or island ferry docks. In short, Sri Lanka's top destinations include ancient cities and temples, tea-covered mountains, wildlife-rich forests, and sunny beaches. Each offers a different experience, and together they pack an incredible amount into one trip.

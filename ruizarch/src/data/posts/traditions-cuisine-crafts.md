Sri Lanka's people and culture are often cited as highlights of any trip. The island is multi-ethnic and multi-religious: about 73% of Sri Lankans are Sinhalese (mostly Buddhist), with Tamil (Hindu) and Moor (Muslim) minorities, plus smaller groups (Christian communities, Malays, Burghers, etc.). This diversity means that Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian holidays are all celebrated widely. Yet Sri Lankans live together peacefully and are known as a loving, welcoming nation. Guests are treated warmly; family hospitality is taken seriously and often includes sharing meals and stories. In fact, an old saying (and greeting) "Ayubowan" (pronounced eye-you-bo-wan) means "may you live long" and is a traditional way to wish someone well. You'll frequently hear it along with a slight bow when meeting people.

Sri Lankan culture places great value on community and generosity. For example, a practice called shramadana (volunteer work) involves neighborhoods coming together to fix roads, clean temples or paint schools. This spirit of cooperation is part of daily life. Culturally, respect for elders and for religious places is also important: always remove your shoes before entering a temple or someone's home, and dress modestly in rural areas or at holy sites. English is widely spoken in cities and tourist areas, making communication easy for travelers.

Sri Lankan cuisine is an essential part of culture. The national meal is rice and curry: a plate of steamed rice piled high and served with multiple small curries (often vegetarian or fish/meat options), plus sambol (spicy relish) and pickles. Street food is vibrant - try kottu (chopped roti mixed with vegetables and spices), hoppers (fermented rice batter pancakes, sometimes with an egg), string hoppers (steamed rice noodles), and pol roti (flatbread with coconut). Sweet tooth? Don't miss wattalapam (a rich coconut custard dessert) or kithul treacle (palm syrup). Tea is the nation's beverage: enjoying a cup of Ceylon tea (with or without milk) is a daily ritual. You can often see neighbors drinking tea together as a social moment. Overall, Sri Lankan cuisine reflects the spice trade history - expect cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and chili, along with curries flavored by coconut milk and tamarind.

Arts and crafts are another vibrant facet. Sri Lanka has traditional dance and drumming styles (like Kandyan dance from Kandy, or Low-country dances), and you'll often see dancers in colorful costumes performing during festivals or cultural shows. Handicrafts include intricate batik fabric designs, carved wooden masks (used in dance rituals), brass and cane homewares, and exquisite silver or jewelry work. In towns like Ambalangoda or Nuwara Eliya, artisans still hand-craft items using methods passed down generations.

Finally, music and entertainment: Sri Lankans love their music, from traditional drumming to modern pop and reggae-Baila beats (a lively style influenced by Portuguese music). Cricket is by far the most popular sport, with everyone from beach players to stadium crowds cheering on the national team. Watching a live cricket match or even listening to a game on a radio in a local cafe is an energetic way to feel connected with the locals.

Through all of these customs and daily life, Sri Lanka remains authentically relaxed and friendly. You'll notice shopkeepers chatting with customers, families strolling on weekends, and children going to school in crisp uniforms. For international tourists, these little cultural experiences - sharing a home-cooked meal, joining a temple celebration, or simply exchanging greetings on the street - often make a trip to Sri Lanka unforgettable.

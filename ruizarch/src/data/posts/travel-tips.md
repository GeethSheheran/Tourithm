Planning a trip to Sri Lanka is exciting, and a few tips will make it smoother. Visa and Entry: Most international visitors (including tourist and business travelers) need an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) to enter Sri Lanka. Since September 2024, all travelers must apply online before arrival. The ETA process is straightforward on the official website and should be done well ahead of your trip – and make sure to pay only through the official portal to avoid extra fees. With the ETA approved, you'll receive an entry stamp on arrival. Passport holders from many countries can still get a visa on arrival or simply pay for an ETA, but check the latest rules online before you go.

When to Visit: Sri Lanka's climate has two monsoon seasons, so the "best time" depends on where you want to go. In general, the peak tourist season is December through April, when the southwest coast and western hills (Colombo, Galle, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, etc.) are mostly dry. The shoulder season of October–November can also be pleasant island-wide. For the east coast (Trincomalee, Pasikudah), the dry season is roughly May–September. Wildlife viewing can be year-round, but try Yala or Wilpattu between January and October, or the elephant aggregation at Minneriya in July–September. Carry light rain gear in case of unexpected showers any time of year, as Sri Lanka is tropical.

Money and Costs: The local currency is the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR). Credit cards are accepted in big hotels, malls, and some restaurants, but always carry some cash for small shops, rural areas, taxis (tuk-tuks), and markets. ATMs are widely available, but ATMs in tourist areas sometimes charge fees. Bargaining over souvenirs and local services is normal in markets and tuk-tuks, but always be polite. Tipping is appreciated in service industries: around 10% in restaurants if service isn't included, and a few hundred rupees for hotel porters or guides.

Health and Safety: Sri Lanka is generally safe for travelers. Petty theft can happen in crowded areas, so keep an eye on belongings. Street food is tasty – go where locals line up. Stick to bottled or purified water to avoid stomach upset, especially in smaller towns. Mosquito-borne illnesses (like dengue) exist, so use repellent and nets, particularly in rural or wet areas. Also remember sun protection: bring high-SPF sunscreen and a hat even if it's cloudy – UV is strong year-round. Electrical outlets in Sri Lanka are usually British-style (230V), so if you have devices with different plugs, pack an adapter.

Culture and Etiquette: Respect local customs: remove shoes and hats when entering temples or some shops, and avoid pointing your feet towards people or religious objects. It's fine to dress casually on beaches and cities, but cover shoulders and knees when visiting temples or rural villages. Language wise, English is widely spoken, so communication is easy in most places. Sri Lankans appreciate when you try a few words of Sinhala or Tamil greetings (like "Ayubowan" or "Vanakkam"), so don't hesitate to ask how to say hello or thank you.

Getting Around: The train network is an adventure – book in advance for famous routes like Colombo–Kandy or Kandy–Ella. Buses connect almost every town (though they can be crowded), and local tuk-tuks (motorized rickshaws) are a convenient way to do short trips around town. For longer distances, private cars with drivers can be arranged and are affordable – often recommended for comfort and flexibility in an itinerary.

With these tips in mind, your Sri Lanka travel will be smoother and more enjoyable. The tourism industry in Sri Lanka is very accustomed to international visitors, so don't hesitate to ask for information or help – you'll usually be met with a friendly smile. By planning for the right season, getting your visa sorted, and respecting local ways, you'll be all set to explore everything this diverse island has to offer.

Buddhism is woven deeply into Sri Lankan life. About 70% of Sri Lankans practice Theravada Buddhism, making it the majority and official religion. In fact, Sri Lanka is one of only five countries in the world with a Theravada Buddhist majority. The tradition was introduced in the 3rd century BC by monks from India, and since then the island has been a center of Buddhist learning and practice. Sri Lankan kings for centuries built great temples and stupas and fostered the Buddhist monastic order. Important ancient scriptures, such as the Pāli Canon, have been preserved here.

Today, every region of the country has its sacred sites. The most famous is the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, which houses a Buddhist relic – believed to be a tooth of the Buddha – enshrined in a richly decorated golden casket. Pilgrims and tourists alike flock to this temple, especially during the annual Esala Perahera (a colorful pageant of dancers, drummers, and decorated elephants). The Rangiri Dambulla Cave Temple (Golden Temple) is another Buddhist treasure: its gilded Buddha statues and painted ceilings date back to the 1st century BC. Sigiriya and Anuradhapura also have ancient temples and shrines.

One spiritual activity unique to Sri Lanka is the climb to Adam's Peak (Sri Pada). This tall mountain in the central highlands has a rock slab near the summit with what Buddhists believe is the footprint of the Buddha (other religions have different interpretations of the mark). Hundreds of thousands of devotees climb the stairway path at night, aiming to reach the top by dawn to see the sun rise over the landscape – a profoundly symbolic experience of devotion and perseverance.

Daily life in Sri Lanka is often punctuated by Buddhist rituals. Monks in ochre robes walk barefoot through towns, collecting alms (food offerings) from residents each morning. At homes and shops, it's common to see small dagobas or Buddhist shrines with incense burning and lotus flowers. Festivals like Vesak (celebrating the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and death in May) transform the country: lanterns (Vesak kites) and stilted temple pandals (temporary shrines) light up the nights, and locals donate free food at dansalas (community food stalls) to honor generosity. Sri Lankans will kindly offer you a free snack or drink at a dansala – accepting it is a way to participate in the spirit of sharing.

Buddhist principles also influence Sri Lankan customs beyond the temple. Non-violence, respect for all life, and compassion are often emphasized. This is part of why Sri Lanka has many national parks to protect wildlife – for example, you will find Ayurvedic treatments and nature lodges that blend spiritual wellness with travel.

For travelers, visiting Sri Lanka's Buddhist sites is both a cultural experience and a moment of peace. Remember to dress modestly (cover shoulders and knees) when entering shrines, and keep quiet out of respect. Lighting oil lamps (found everywhere) and tying protective cloths around Buddha statues are ways some visitors engage with local practices. Even if you are not Buddhist, witnessing the devotion and serenity in Sri Lankan temples can be moving. It's a chance to appreciate how spirituality and history shape the island's identity.
